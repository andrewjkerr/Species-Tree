Species-Tree
============

Takes in a species.xml file and allows users to perform various search operations.

The parsing uses RapidXML which can be found here: http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/

No idea exactly where the species.xml file came from originally, but was given to us by our Data Structures professor who's page can be found here: http://cise.ufl.edu/~jdepree
